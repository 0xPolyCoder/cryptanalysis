This document describes how I did solve the task 02 of the practical task. The The task involves find an encryption algorithm to be able to decrypt the file `task02.cryp` with two different keys (`sentence_1.key` and `sentence_2.key`) to yield two distinct plaintexts (`p1` and `p2`), which are the contents of the given files`sentence_1.txt` and `sentence_2.txt`, respectively.

## Algorithm Used

-   **Name**: XOR Cipher
-   **Type**: Symmetric Key Algorithm

The XOR Cipher is a basic form of encryption that uses the bitwise XOR operation. It is symmetric, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.

## Files

-   `sentence_1.txt` (p1)
-   `sentence_2.txt` (p2)
-   `task02.cryp` (c)
-   `sentence_1.key` (Key k1 for decryption to p1, generated by `solver.py` custom script)
-   `sentence_2.key` (Key k2 for decryption to p2, generated by `solver.py`custom script)

## Instructions

1.  **Read the Ciphertext and Keys**:
    -   Read the contents of `task02.cryp`, `sentence_1.key`, and `sentence_2.key`.
2.  **Perform XOR Cipher to generate keys**:
    -   Apply the XOR Cipher by XORing the ciphertext `task02.cryp` with `p1`then with `p2`.
	    -  we get as a result:
		    - `k1` saved as `sentence_1.key`.
		    - `k2` saved as `sentence_2.key`.
3.  **Verify the Decryption With XOR cipher**:
    -   decrypting `task02.cryp` using `sentence_1.key` gives `sentence_1.txt`.
    -   decrypting `task02.cryp` using `sentence_2.key` gives `sentence_2.txt`.
    - This satify the given condition.
4. **Additional: the solver script is included**:
	- Can run and print both keys and shows `the solution is correct` if the given condition is true.
